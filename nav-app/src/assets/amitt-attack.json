      "description": "Advance competing narratives connected to same issue ie: on one hand deny incident while at same time expresses dismiss. MH17 (example) \"Russian Foreign Ministry again claimed that “absolutely groundless accusations are put forward against the Russian side, which are aimed at discrediting Russia in the eyes of the international community\" (deny); \"The Dutch MH17 investigation is biased, anti-Russian and factually inaccurate\" (dismiss). \n\nSuppressing or discouraging narratives already spreading requires an alternative. The most simple set of narrative techniques in response would be the construction and promotion of contradictory alternatives centered on denial, deflection, dismissal, counter-charges, excessive standards of proof, bias in prohibition or enforcement, and so on.\n\nThese competing narratives allow loyalists cover, but are less compelling to opponents and fence-sitters than campaigns built around existing narratives or highly explanatory master narratives. Competing narratives, as such, are especially useful in the \"firehose of misinformation\" approach.",

      "description": "The promotion of beneficial master narratives is perhaps the most effective method for achieving long-term strategic narrative dominance. From a \"whole of society\" perpective the promotion of the society's core master narratives should occupy a central strategic role. From a misinformation campaign / cognitive security perpectve the tactics around master narratives center more precisely on the day-to-day promotion and reinforcement of this messaging. In other words, beneficial, high-coverage master narratives are a central strategic goal and their promotion consitutes an ongoing tactical struggle carried out at a whole-of-society level. \n\nBy way of example, major powers are promoting master narratives such as:\n* \"Huawei is detetmined to build trustworthy networks\"\n* \"Russia is the victim of bullying by NATO powers\"\n* \"USA is guided by its founding principles of liberty and egalitarianism\"\n\nTactically, their promotion covers a broad spectrum of activities both on- and offline.",

EU Elections (2019) Avaaz reported more than 500 suspicious pages and groups to Facebook related to the three-month investigation of Facebook disinformation networks in Europe. Mueller report (2016) The IRA was able to reach up to 126 million Americans on Facebook via a mixture of fraudulent accounts, groups, and advertisements, the report says.

It was even able to hold real-life rallies, mobilizing hundreds of people at a time in major cities like Philadelphia and Miami. ",

Create a perception of reality around an event. Certainly only \"real\" events would be discussed in a hashtag. After all, the event has a name!\n2. Publicize the story more widely through trending lists and search behavior \n\nAsset needed to direct/control/manage \"conversation\" connected to launching new incident/campaign with new hashtag for applicable social media sites ie: Twitter, LinkedIn)",

Leveraging existing narratives is not only more effective, it requires substantially less resourcing, as the promotion of new master narratives operates on a much larger scale, both time and scope. Fluid, dynamic & often interchangable key master narratives can be (\"The morally corrupt West\") adapted to divisive (LGBT proganda) or to distort (individuals working as CIA operatives). For Western audiences, different but equally powerful framings are available, such as \"USA has a fraught history in race relations, espically in crimincal justice areas.\"",

      "description": "\"Misinformation promotes an agenda by advancing narratives supportive of that agenda. This is most effective when the advanced narrative pre-dates the revelation of the specific misinformation content. But this is often not possible. \n\nSuppressing or discouraging narratives already spreading requires an alternative. The most simple set of narrative techniques in response would be the construction and promotion of contradictory alternatives centered on denial, deflection, dismissal, counter-charges, excessive standards of proof, bias in prohibition or enforcement, and so on. \n\nThese competing narratives allow loyalists cover, but are less compelling to opponents and fence-sitters than campaigns built around existing narratives or highly explanatory master narratives. Competing narratives, as such, are especially useful in the \"\"firehose of misinformation\"\" approach.\"",
